# TopCoderExercises

I've just found out TopCoders and realized there's been a while since college,
so I decided to take some time on this weekend to do some exercises and get
``unrusted''.

Although the site has a column on the statistics pages for Python, I've seen no 
implementations using it, anyway, as my goal was to refresh the memory, I've
used it anyway.
